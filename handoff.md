> ## ⭐ NEXT-UP BACKLOG (owner-prioritized 2026-07-06 — pick up IN THIS ORDER)
> 1. ✅ **DONE (2026-07-06, PR #22, merge `02f3d5c`) — `src/data/grid.py:load_qualifying_grid` date-gate.**
>    The last ungated fastf1 read is closed: `session_in_future(getattr(s,"date",None))` guard reads `s.date`
>    BEFORE `.load()` and returns `{}` (the existing "no grid yet" degrade) for a future session, same pattern
>    as `load_session`. +2 tests (future → gated before load; past → loads normally). Same PR also flipped the
>    16 new M7 explainer concepts `drafted`→`verified` (owner editorial call; all 24 now verified).
> 2. ✅ **DONE / MOOT (verified 2026-07-07) — Historical-season (2023–25) sprint-points backfill.** The
>    concern was that `build_2026.py` is incremental (`load_results(..., refresh_year=LIVE_SEASON)`, L167)
>    so the sprint-in-standings change only reached the LIVE (2026) season_results. **On inspection the
>    2023–25 rows ALREADY include sprint points** (both `data/` and the deployed `api/season_results.parquet`):
>    e.g. 2023 Azerbaijan/Belgium/Qatar/USA = 33 (25 race + 8 sprint), Austria = 34 (+1 FL); old race-only
>    code could never exceed 26. A fresh full re-pull of 2023 with the current code is **byte-identical** to
>    the committed table (max abs points diff 0.0, 0/439 rows differ). The tables were regenerated with the
>    sprint-folding code in the Jul 6 20:11 rebuild, AFTER this note was first written. `podium_features`
>    (built from the same `results` in the same rebuild) is consistent → train/serve champ_points already
>    aligned. **No action needed; a rebuild would only churn non-deterministic parquet with zero data change.**
> 3. ✅ **RESOLVED (2026-07-17, PR #26) — investigated as a model change, landed as an explainer/context feature after a validation NO-GO.** See the session entry below. The model-weight idea was tested and REJECTED honestly: grid already dominates the podium model (standardized logistic coef −2.5, top feature by 3×), and a per-track grid×stickiness INTERACTION does NOT beat baseline on leakage-safe rolling-origin CV (23 held-out races: top3 0.696 flat / Brier flat-or-worse; front-row already well-calibrated pred 0.67 vs actual 0.68 — the earlier "undersold" feeling was a DRY-subset small-sample artifact). Per house rules (don't tune the bar / don't overfit one Silverstone anecdote) the MODEL IS UNTOUCHED. The real per-track stickiness spread (Spearman ρ 0.43 Las Vegas → 0.90 Monaco/Japan) instead ships as grounded narrative CONTEXT. **Deferred alternatives if ever revisited:** none recommended — the interaction is a genuine no-edge; evidence in the spec §0.
> 4. **M7 runway to public launch:** visual polish + optional championship projection (the last M7 slices).
> 7. **`/accuracy` chart enhancement — "graph is just a line, needs more info"** (owner, 2026-07-18). The
>    calibration trend chart reads as a bare line; add information density (per-round markers, the Brier
>    co-metric legend, axis labels, hover/tooltips). Frontend-only UX slice; spec §9 of the atomic-rebuild spec.
> 8. ✅ **RESOLVED (2026-07-18, PR #30) — cron reordered to due-write → reconcile → rebuild.** The due-write now
>    runs FIRST and claims the current race's `final` LIVE (unflagged); reconcile then no-ops it (`alreadyPresent`)
>    and stays the safety-net for genuinely-missed rounds; rebuild last. Extracted to a testable
>    `app/lib/snapshot-cron.ts:runSnapshotCron` (due-write isolated in its own try/catch) so the ORDER is
>    regression-guarded (test asserts calls == ["write","reconcile","rebuild"]). Missed-final safety preserved
>    (reconcile still runs unconditionally every fire). FORWARD-LOOKING: relabels no existing rows; the first race
>    captured live after deploy becomes a 2nd live row on `/accuracy`, and the live count grows from there. See
>    session entry below.
> 6. ✅ **RESOLVED (2026-07-18, option b, in PR #27) — pre-beta backfill on `/accuracy` labeled, not counted.**
>    The reconciler backfills EVERY completed round including pre-beta rounds (Australia…Barcelona) we never
>    forecast live. Chosen fix (owner, option b): stamp post-hoc backfills `reconstructed` and on `/accuracy`
>    EXCLUDE them from the headline (top3/Brier) + trend chart while still LISTING them labeled **"From testing ·
>    not predicted live"**. See the session entry below. Post-hoc writes (reconciler + admin) stamp
>    `reconstructed:true`; the LIVE cron due-write never does, so a live-captured final (Austria) stays counted.
>    **OWNER STEP after PR #27 deploys:** re-stamp the 8 already-written rows (7 pre-beta + GB) via the admin
>    backfill loop (spec §6; Austria EXCLUDED) — until then they still show as live/counted. Future misses
>    auto-flag via the reconciler.
> 5. ✅ **DONE (2026-07-07, PR #23 MERGED to `main` → live on prod).** See the session entry below. Recommend confirming the *populated* modal on prod (`/weekend`, Belgium setup screen → "Check out Great Britain GP" link). **`/weekend` — show the PREVIOUS GP's predictions during the pre-predictions "setting up" state** (owner
>    idea 2026-07-06; priority vs 2–4 owner's call). While `/weekend` is in the `!snap || concluded` branch —
>    the "We're still setting up our garage at {circuit}… Check back Saturday" screen (`app/weekend/page.tsx`
>    ~L80-124), before this weekend's snapshot exists — give the user a sense of what to expect by surfacing
>    the LAST race's predictions. Owner's mechanism: a **"grow underline" link** (the existing `cta-grow` hover
>    style used site-wide) that opens a **modal/popover** with the previous GP's predictions **table** (podium
>    odds). **Data already exists — read-only, no pipeline/Python/cron change:** the prior weekend's frozen
>    predictions live in Blob at `snapshotKey(year, prevGp, "final")` (exactly what `/accuracy` reads via
>    `loadRaceRows`). Need to (a) resolve "previous GP" — `weekend-schedule.json` has `gp`/`nextGp` but no
>    `prevGp`; derive from `RACE_CALENDAR`/calendar order or add a `prevGp` field; (b) reuse the podium-table
>    markup already in `weekend/page.tsx` (L152-192 — worth extracting a shared `<PodiumTable>`); (c) reuse the
>    existing portalled fade+scale **modal pattern** from the M4 per-driver stops modal. Frontend-only slice
>    (its own spec→plan→build); gate motion behind `prefers-reduced-motion`; the modal must be clearly labelled
>    as the PAST race's call (not the upcoming one). **Note:** the empty/"setting up" branch also fires
>    post-race for `nextGp` (`concluded` at L78), so the "previous GP" it references is context-dependent —
>    resolve it from whichever upcoming gp is being shown.
>
> **Owner Qs answered (2026-07-06), re `/accuracy` (`app/accuracy/page.tsx`):**
> - **Does accuracy update automatically? YES.** The page is `force-dynamic` and reads the LIVE Blob season
>   calibration index (`seasonIndexKey`) that the cron appends to when a race's `final` checkpoint is scored
>   (final → actuals → calibration). So each concluded round shows up on the next page load — no manual step,
>   as long as the daily snapshot cron actually hits the race's `final` window (the `?force=1` re-snapshot from
>   the 07-04 firefight is the manual fallback if a checkpoint is missed).
> - **Is it supposed to have a graph? YES — but only at ≥3 scored races.** `CalibrationChart` renders behind
>   `summary.nRaces >= 3` (L89) — a deliberate honesty gate (don't draw a season trend from 1–2 points). Early
>   season correctly shows the scorecard + race-by-race rows and NO chart; the graph appears once ≥3 rounds are
>   scored. So "no graph yet" is expected behaviour, not a bug.

> ## 2026-07-18 session — cron reorder so due-write claims the live final (backlog #8): PR #30

> Subagent-driven: 1 task + review (Approved, no Critical/Important).
> **Problem:** cron order was reconcile → due-write → rebuild, so `reconcileFinals` front-ran the due-write and
> wrote the current race's `final` as `reconstructed:true` even when the cron fired in its live window (due-write
> then short-circuited `alreadyPresent`). Every future race would be labeled testing → live count stuck at 1.
> **Fix:** reorder to **due-write → reconcile → rebuild**, extracted into `app/lib/snapshot-cron.ts:runSnapshotCron`
> (pure, dep-injected, due-write isolated in its own try/catch) so the order is unit-tested (regression guard:

> ## 2026-07-18 session — atomic calibration-index rebuild (prod data-integrity fix): PR #29
> Fixes a prod data bug found while verifying the reconstructed-labeling: `/accuracy` dropped rows (Australia/
> Japan/Canada vanished) and mis-flagged rounds. Root-caused via systematic-debugging; spec/plan
> `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-07-18-calibration-index-atomic-rebuild*`; ledger `.superpowers/sdd/progress.md`.
> Subagent-driven: 3 tasks + per-task reviews + opus whole-branch review (READY TO MERGE, zero Critical/Important).
> **Root cause (two defects, one root):** the season calibration index is a SINGLE Blob key that
> `writeWeekendSnapshot` updated via non-atomic read-modify-write, called once-per-round in loops (the reconciler's
> internal loop + the manual restamp shell loop I gave the owner). D1: under Blob eventual consistency, a later
> round reads the index before an earlier round's write is visible → overwrites it → LOST ROWS. D2: the
> `if (!idx.some(gp===gp))` guard made a forced re-stamp a silent no-op for already-present rows. (My restamp-loop
> instruction directly triggered D1 — owned + fixed.)
> **Fix — decouple + atomic projection:** (1) **`writeWeekendSnapshot` stops writing the index entirely** (RMW
> deleted at source); it stamps `reconstructed` onto the SNAPSHOT object instead (`WeekendSnapshot.reconstructed`),
> set by reconciler + admin (post-hoc) but NOT the live cron due-write. (2) **`app/lib/calibration-index.ts:
> rebuildCalibrationIndex`** reads every `final` snapshot in `race_calendar` (calendar) order and writes the whole
> index in ONE `putJson` — race-free by construction; a pure projection that self-heals (a transient
> eventual-consistency miss recovers next rebuild; snapshots are the source of truth, never destructively mutated).
> `safeRebuildCalibrationIndex` guards it. (3) **Cron rebuilds LAST** (reconcile → due-write → rebuild) each fire;
> new **`/api/admin/rebuild-calibration`** (CRON_SECRET) for on-demand recovery. Fixes race-ordering too (your
> "races should appear in order of occurrence" point). No summarize/prediction/Python/vercel/R17 change; 7 files.
> **VERIFIED:** vitest 186 pass/2 skip, tsc+build clean; Python untouched.
> **OWNER STEP after deploy — RUN PROMPTLY (whole-branch review M1):** labels do NOT self-heal, only rows do. The
> 8 pre-existing test snapshots lack `snap.reconstructed` (old code only wrote the flag to the index ROW), so the
> first cron auto-rebuild yields 9 UNFLAGGED rows → the headline over-counts live races until you re-stamp. Recovery
> (spec §6): (a) run the admin-backfill loop over the 8 (7 pre-beta + GB, **Austria excluded**) — now SAFE in a loop
> since it writes only snapshot keys (no index); (b) `curl ".../api/admin/rebuild-calibration" -H "Authorization:
> Bearer $CRON_SECRET"` once → clean 9-row calendar-ordered index (Austria live + 8 labeled testing). See NEW
> BACKLOG #8 (cron ordering / future-live-label stall) + #7 (chart needs more info).
> **DEBUGGING LESSON:** never mutate a shared aggregate (single Blob key) via read-modify-write in a loop over an
> eventually-consistent store — make it a projection rebuilt in one atomic write. The manual admin backfill is safe
> per-round ONLY because each call writes an independent snapshot key; the INDEX must never be a per-round RMW.

> ## 2026-07-18 session — /accuracy reconstructed-round labeling (honesty follow-up, backlog #6): PR #27 (stacked)
> Stacked on the reconciler in the SAME PR #27 (ships together so there's no live window where /accuracy blends

> **Why:** the reconciler backfills pre-beta rounds (Australia…Barcelona) we never forecast live; scoring them on
> `/accuracy` as if live overstates the track record. Owner chose option (b): label + exclude from headline.
> **What shipped:** (1) **post-hoc writes stamp `reconstructed`** — `writeWeekendSnapshot` gains a

> (`{force:false,reconstructed:true}`) and ADMIN backfill (`{force,reconstructed:true}`) pass it; the LIVE cron
> due-write NEVER does (Austria's live-captured final stays counted). Default path row shape byte-unchanged.
> (2) **`summarize` (calibration.ts)** aggregates headline top3/Brier + cumulative chart over LIVE rows only
> (`!reconstructed`); adds `nReconstructed`. (3) **`/accuracy` page** lists the FULL index (gates on
> `index.length`, so testing rows show even at 0 live), renders top3/Brier only when `nRaces>0`, "Races scored"

> **VERIFIED:** full branch vitest 183 pass/2 skip, tsc+build clean; pytest untouched.
> **OWNER STEP after deploy (spec §6):** the 8 already-written reconstructed rows (7 pre-beta + GB) predate the

> ## 2026-07-17 session — snapshot final-capture reconciler (known-gap hardening): PR #27

> Subagent-driven: 3 tasks + per-task reviews + opus whole-branch review (READY TO MERGE, zero Critical/Important).
> **Root cause (systematic, not a fluke):** the daily snapshot cron (`0 6 * * *`) only writes the CURRENT
> `schedule.gp`'s due checkpoint. R17 self-rolls `schedule.gp` to the next race once the race date passes (Sun
> 18:00), BEFORE the next cron fires (Mon 06:00) — so a race's `final` (freezes past-predictions + scores
> calibration) is systematically missed unless the cron happens to fire in the post-race window before the roll.
> Exact GB-2026 failure; every race was exposed; manual backfill was the only recovery.
> **What shipped:** (1) **`app/lib/reconcile-finals.ts`** (new, 6 vitest) — `reconcileFinals(year, rounds, deps)`
> per round: `final` snapshot exists → `alreadyPresent`; else `getActualFinish` empty → `notRaced` (gate that
> excludes the un-raced upcoming target AND self-heals transient `/api/results` failures, retry next day); else

> (behavior-preserving rename) for reuse. (3) **`app/api/cron/snapshot/route.ts`** — run `safeReconcileFinals` on
> EVERY fire, BEFORE the due-checkpoint logic (the missed-final case is exactly when nothing is due for the current
> gp); `reconcile` summary added to the response. Idempotent (existence check + force:false + calibration-index gp
> guard). No new cron / vercel.json / R17 / admin / Python / data change; 4 files.
> **VERIFIED:** vitest 177 pass/2 skip, tsc+build clean. Python untouched.
> **BEHAVIOR ON DEPLOY:** first real cron fire (or manual `curl "<deploy>/api/cron/snapshot" -H "Authorization:
> Bearer $CRON_SECRET"`) backfills EVERY completed 2026 round missing a `final` → `/accuracy` may jump from ~2

> **Why NOT a model change:** grid already DOMINATES the podium model (standardized logistic coef −2.5, top feature
> by 3×), so "grid doesn't weight enough" is not globally true. Per-track grid→finish stickiness is real and large

> **What shipped:** (1) **`src/inference/stickiness.py`** (new, pure, 12 pytest) — `circuit_grid_stickiness(podium_features,
> gp, year)` = Spearman ρ(grid, finish) over STRICTLY-PRIOR runnings (`year < target`, leakage-safe), tiered
> (sticky ρ≥0.80 / high_overtaking ρ<0.60 / average), `n<2` runnings → None. `grid_context_line(stickiness, drivers)`

> driver (grid≤3); average/thin/no-front-row/Friday → silent. (2) **`predict_podium`** attaches `grid_context`

> **VERIFIED:** pytest 223, vitest 171/2-skip, tsc+build clean.
> **CAVEAT (repo pattern, M2 finding):** the end-to-end NARRATIVE text only renders on a real deploy (Haiku +

> **RESOLUTION (2026-07-07, PR #24 `backfill-gb-final-snapshot`, open):** owner chose to BACKFILL GB via a new

> **OWNER STEP once PR #24 deploys:** `curl ".../api/admin/snapshot?gp=Great%20Britain&checkpoint=final" -H

> fall back to the latest prior race that HAS a snapshot.
> **DONE (2026-07-07): PR #24 MERGED + GB backfilled live** (owner ran the curl from the PR #24 preview → shared
> Blob; verified GB now on `/weekend` link + `/accuracy`). **PR #25 MERGED** — label fix: the link/modal now read

> **KNOWN GAP — deferred (2026-07-07, agreed "deal with next time"):** the AUTOMATIC per-race capture is

> silently skipped on BOTH `/weekend`'s prev-GP modal and `/accuracy` (graceful, no error). Backstop today =
> the manual `/api/admin/snapshot` backfill. HARDENING IDEAS for later: (a) drive final-snapshot capture from

> The durable fix behind the 07-04 firefight — **retires the per-table boundary guards** (`_has_raced`,

> tasks (Task 5 = controller-run fastf1 rebuild) + opus whole-branch review + 1 fix.
> **What shipped:** (1) **date-gate at the two load chokepoints** — `src/data/load.py:session_in_future` +
> gate in `load_session`; gate in `src/data/results.py:load_season_results`. Skips any session whose
> scheduled date (`s.date`, fastf1 naive-UTC, read BEFORE `.load()`) is in the future. The old "no laps"
> guard couldn't catch it (fastf1 returns leaked laps). **Every feature table is race-gated**, so this
> removes the un-raced target from ALL tables uniformly. (2) **Sprint-in-standings** — `load_season_results`
> folds Sprint session points into championship `points` (additive; `finish_pos`/form stay main-race-only;
> verified British GP LEC 29=25+4sprint). (3) **Build-time fail-safe** — `scripts/build_2026.py:
> assert_no_unraced_target` RAISES if an un-raced target leaks into any live-season table (covers pit_loss;
> matches BOTH the short calendar key AND fastf1's LONG EventName — season_results keys gp by "Belgian Grand
> Prix", the fix's key finding). Runs after build, before the api/ copy → R17 fails safe. (4) **Retired
> `_has_raced` + `_race_concluded` + the weekend-schedule vercel bundle** — shipped WITH the clean rebuild
> (no leaked-table-without-guard window). (5) **Regenerated bundled `api/*.parquet`** through the gated
> pipeline; reconciled 2 pre-existing stale-fixture tests (test_actual_stops "Belgium not in RACE_CALENDAR"
> → beyond-calendar skip; grid.test.ts "GB no grid" → Monaco).
> **DESIGN NOTE (corrected mid-build):** there is NO upcoming-strategy target builder (only podium has one),
> and build_strategy_table needs race laps. So the occurred-gate makes the upcoming weekend's STRATEGY fall
> to the **historical norm** (the original contract) — the pre-race Model-B "predicted" mode we'd seen was
> ENTIRELY the leak. A true pre-race stop-count prediction needs its own FP2 target builder (separate future slice).
> **VERIFIED:** pytest 205, vitest 157/2skip, tsc+build clean; gated build_2026 ran clean + assertion PASSED;
> all 7 api tables 0 Belgium rows; end-to-end (guards removed): GB podium saturday/0-null, Belgium podium
> friday/0-null (upcoming builder), Belgium strategy HISTORICAL.
> **FOLLOW-UPS (logged, out of scope):** (a) `src/data/grid.py:load_qualifying_grid` still ungated — a leaked
> future quali could write a premature grid (same leak class; one-line `session_in_future` guard for the
> backlog). (b) Historical-season (2023-25) sprint backfill deferred — build_2026 is incremental so only the
> LIVE season got sprint points (train/serve champ uses RANK → negligible); a one-time build_all would backfill.
> (c) Grid-weight calibration (LEC P2 felt low) — separate tuning slice, still deferred.

> ## 2026-07-04 session — RACE-EVE FIREFIGHT (British GP, sprint weekend): 6 PRs MERGED to `origin/main` + live
> Owner hit multiple prod issues the day before the British GP main race. **ONE root cause behind most of
> them: the fastf1 FUTURE-DATA LEAK.** The un-raced GB *main race* leaked into the bundled feature tables
> (fastf1 exposes future/other sessions), producing fabricated rows. Symptoms + fixes (all merged):
> - **Grey driver helmets** (NOT the tyre glyph — a red herring). TWO causes: (a) 2026 team-name strings
>   from the data don't match `teams.json` keys → grey `NEUTRAL` fallback → **PR #14** added a `TEAM_ALIASES`
>   map (`app/lib/glyph.ts`: Red Bull→Red Bull Racing, Alpine F1 Team→Alpine, RB F1 Team→Racing Bulls,
>   AlphaTauri/Alfa Romeo lineage) + **added Audi + Cadillac F1 Team to `teams.json`** (new 2026 teams;
>   colors are sensible defaults, tunable). (b) **THE actual fix — PR #17:** `api/podium.py` routed GB to the
>   HISTORICAL `predict_podium` path because GB leaked into `podium_features` (with fabricated finish but
>   NULL team) → returned 20 null-team rows. New **`_has_raced(rid)` guard** (team populated = genuinely
>   raced) routes leaked GB to the upcoming builder → 22 clean rows WITH teams. **PR #15** hardened
>   `predict_upcoming_podium` to drop leaked target rows from history before concat (was 42 rows/dup drivers;
>   the "42-driver bug"). NOTE: #14 alone didn't fix it (leaked rows had null team, not a mappable name; and
>   #15's path wasn't even reached until #17 fixed the routing — DEBUGGING LESSON: check the LIVE endpoint,
>   don't fix from data analysis alone).
> - **`/weekend` showed no predictions / stayed grey.** `/weekend` reads a FROZEN Blob snapshot written by the
>   **Vercel cron (daily `0 6 * * *`) — a SEPARATE job from R17.** R17 refreshing data does NOT write the
>   snapshot. The daily cron hadn't hit a GB checkpoint window. **PR #16** added an auth-gated **`?force=1`**
>   to `/api/cron/snapshot` (overwrite the frozen snapshot; idempotent calibration append). OWNER ran
>   `curl ".../api/cron/snapshot?force=1" -H "Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>"` → snapshotted → `/weekend`
>   rebuilt CLEAN (verified: HAM/ANT/RUS/... colored). **Re-run `?force=1` after any data fix to refresh
>   `/weekend`.**
> - **"british gp" query → "United Kingdom" unsupported.** Parser emits "United Kingdom"; not in the circuit
>   aliases. **PR #18** added `united kingdom`/`england` → Great Britain (`app/lib/circuits.ts`).
> - **Strategy showed a fabricated "actual" for GB** (same leak, into `actual_stops` — fully-populated row, no
>   null-field tell). **PR #19** gates the `actual` branch on a DATE signal: bundled `app/data/weekend-schedule.json`
>   into `api/strategy.py` + `_race_concluded(year,gp)` (only serve "actual" once the schedule target's `final`
>   time passes). GB now falls through to Model-B "predicted" — but that's on a SEPARATELY leaked
>   `strategy_features` row (GB is a sprint weekend = no real FP2), so it's still not fully honest → root gate (below).
> **All 6 PRs (#14-#19) merged + live; branches deleted. 197 pytest + full vitest green.**
> **ARCHITECTURE LEARNINGS (load-bearing):** (1) `/weekend` = frozen Blob snapshot (cron), NOT live and NOT R17;
> refresh via `?force=1`. (2) fastf1 leaks future/other sessions → any table built over a calendar that
> includes the un-raced target (the data-currency auto-calendar DOES) can get fabricated rows; the podium
> `_has_raced` + strategy `_race_concluded` are per-table BOUNDARY guards, not the root fix.
> **PARKED — deliberate POST-RACE data-integrity pass (one clean spec→plan→build slice):**
> (a) **ROOT occurred-gate** — stop un-raced targets leaking into ANY feature table (podium/strategy/actual_stops/
> season_results) at BUILD time (date-based; strategy_features is special — FP2 practice IS valid pre-race, but a
> sprint weekend has no FP2). Retires the per-table boundary guards + stops R17 re-leaking each run. Also the GB
> strategy "predicted"-on-leaked-FP is only fully fixed here. (b) **Sprint-in-standings** — fold sprint points into
> `season_results` (currently GP-only: 8 events × 22, no sprint rows; predictions do NOT factor sprint results —
> minor accuracy gap, within-weekend ordering is the fiddly part). (c) **`m7-explainers-expansion` branch**

## ✨ Post-M5 fine-tuning (2026-06-22) — output quality, NOT M6

Owner-directed tuning pass before the learning layer. Branch `fine-tune-output-pitloss`
(committed, **not merged/deployed** — owner decision). 152 pytest + 78 vitest (+2 skipped
live-smoke), `npm run build` + `tsc` clean. Four changes:

1. **"Next race" resolves** (`app/lib/next-race.ts`). "Who's gonna be on the podium at the
   next race?" used to error; now the parser emits `gp:"next race"` and the orchestrator
   maps it (and a bare "who's gonna podium?") to the upcoming weekend from
   `app/data/weekend-schedule.json` (Austria now, auto-rolls to `nextGp` once the race
   finishes). Applies to podium/pace/strategy.
2. **Pit-lane time loss is now DATA-DERIVED for ALL circuits** (`src/features/pit_loss.py` →
   `build_pit_loss` → `data/pit_loss.parquet`, bundled to `api/`; read by `lookup_stat`
   with a `pit_table`/`year`). Replaces the curated spike estimates AND the null fallback.
   The number is the FULL stop cost INCLUDING the ~2.5s stationary change (the F1-website
   convention — owner + web-confirmed). **Red Bull Ring → 20.8s (2025)** vs F1's 20.3 (within
   margin; owner accepted derived-with-margin over exact curated). **Year-aware**: defaults
   to the latest season held; `year` threads parser→orchestrate→`/api/inference`. Carries
   grounded **insights** (the ~2.5s stationary share + calendar ranking "shortest/longest
   pit-lane loss", computed from our own table). Caveat: single-sample 2026 circuits are
   noisy (China 15.4, n=7). NOT shipped: per-track fastest-stop record + team (fastf1 has no
   reliable stationary/stop duration — owner accepted the longest/shortest pit-lane facts as
   the alternative). `track.py` Austria curated prior also corrected 21.0→20.3 (feature-only).
3. **Smarter narratives ACROSS the platform** (podium, pace, strategy, stat lookups).
   `predict_podium` now surfaces per-driver `factors` (champ_rank, recent_form_avg_finish,
   track_pace_delta_s, grid) so the narrative explains the *why* ("leads on championship
   position, quick here last year") not just odds. All four `*_SYSTEM` prompts rewritten to
   be insightful + grounded, and may use ≤1 sentence from an **allowlisted** array only —
   curated `circuit-facts.json` wired via `withContext` in `orchestrate.ts` + the new
   `insights` field. Hard rule kept: never free LLM recall / invented facts.
4. **R17 refresh wired** — `build_pit_loss` added to `build_all` AND `scripts/build_2026.py`
   (incremental step 4/6, live-season merge, validated: picks up 7 completed 2026 rounds,
   preserves 48 history rows, skips unraced Austria gracefully). Both workflow copies
   (`.github/workflows/` + `docs/ops/`) stage `pit_loss.parquet`; `git add api/*.parquet`
   already caught it. So live pit-loss now refreshes each weekend with the other tables.

**Follow-ups:** China/single-sample 2026 noise (consider a min-stop threshold or multi-year
median if "latest" reads wrong); Barcelona↔Spain key collision means a 2026-Barcelona
pit-loss row is unreachable via the "Spain"-normalized lookup (harmless, pre-existing).

## 🎯 1. Current Goal & Status

**Ultimate goal of Phase 1:** Decide — cheaply, on rich 2023–2025 historical data —
whether FP-telemetry features can power Sector 4's predictions, *before* building any
app. Pure data/ML validation; no frontend/LLM/API (phase discipline).

**Where we are now: Phase 1 is COMPLETE.** Five spikes run, go/no-go reached on every
capability, all work committed and pushed to `origin/main`. The consolidated result:

| Capability | Telemetry edge over baseline? |
|---|---|
| Model A — podium vs grid (Saturday) | **No** (FP pace ρ≈0.45 vs grid ρ≈0.66; grid ≈0.78 top-3) |
| Model A — pre-quali podium vs standings/form (Friday) | **No** (FP dominated by standings ρ0.71 / form ρ0.61) |
| Quali-sim pace → grid vs standings | **No** (0.636 ≈ 0.640) |
| **Model B — stop-count strategy vs track-norm** | **YES (+0.07: 0.711 vs 0.641)** |
| Model B — dominant compound vs track-norm | **No** (0.733 = 0.733) |

**Telemetry's two VALIDATED contributions:** (1) predicted **pace gaps + uncertainty**
(Model A, demoted to supporting), and (2) **stop-count strategy** (Model B). Podium
ranking and dominant compound run on public/historical baselines (grid, standings,
form, historical compound norms) with no telemetry edge.

**Repositioning (this session, docs-only):** the product pivots from "Predictive
Telemetry Intelligence" (an oracle) to an **explainer-led F1 weekend companion** — it
competes on experience, honesty, and explanation, not predictive edge. `sector4-prd.md`
(§1, §3, §5 + new §5.1 findings, §6.2, §6.4, §6.6 learning-layer redesign, §7.2, §11
M1–M7 milestones, §12) and `CLAUDE.md` were rewritten to match; this `handoff.md`
refreshed. **51 unit tests still pass; no code changed.** The full Phase-1 pipeline,
tests, and `notebooks/*_RESULTS.md` evidence are on `main`.

## 🚫 2. Failed Approaches & Experiments (DO NOT REPEAT)

- **Sorting weekends by `race_id` (alphabetical) before rolling-origin CV** → silent
  **look-ahead leakage** (trained on December races to predict March). FIX: pass an
  explicit *calendar-ordered* race list (`ordered_races`) into the CV/baselines.
- **Selecting each driver's *fastest* FP stint + OLS deg slope** → garbage features:
  fastest stint = low-fuel quali sim (misrepresents race pace); OLS on 4–5 laps
  produced physically impossible ±11 s/lap slopes. FIX: use the *longest* stint +
  **Theil-Sen** robust slope + clip to [-0.5, 1.0].
- **First circuit set (5 all-low-overtaking tracks)** made the grid baseline look
  artificially strong (73% top-3) and raised a false "circuit bias" worry. FIX:
  representative 8-circuit set spanning the overtaking spectrum — which *refuted* the
  worry (grid rose to 78%, i.e. grid is genuinely dominant).
- **Quali-sim-predicted grid as a podium-classifier feature** → *hurt* held-out top-3
  (−0.044); cut. **Constructor standings** → no gain; cut. (Incremental ablation works.)
- **`class_weight="balanced"` logistic for podium probabilities** → overconfident
  (predicts 0.86 where actual rate is 0.49). Probabilities are NOT yet calibrated.
- **Infra gotchas already fixed:** `to_parquet` needs `pyarrow` (now pinned); fastf1
  `enable_cache` requires the dir to exist first; running a script from `notebooks/`
  breaks `import src` without a sys.path bootstrap; unanchored `data/` in `.gitignore`
  silently ignored `src/data/` (now `/data/`).

## 🔑 3. Key Decisions & Rationale

- **Validate on 2023–2025, never 2026** — 2026 is the sparse reg-reset; training there
  would be a false negative. (House rule.)
- **Rolling-origin CV only** (train races 1..N, predict N+1); never random k-fold on a
  small time-ordered sample. **Strict leakage guards:** nothing race-derived feeds the
  prediction of that race; standings/form/track-history from strictly prior races; FP
  from this weekend only.
- **Evaluation contract:** MAE judged on actual *race pace*; top-3 and Spearman judged
  on actual *finishing order* (DNFs/strategy matter for the product metric).
- **Representative 8-circuit dry set:** Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Hungary, Italy,
  Mexico City, Las Vegas, Abu Dhabi (all conventional/non-sprint, recurring 2023–25).
- **Logic lives in `src/`**, notebooks/scripts only orchestrate (eases production port).
- **Model A demoted** to pace-gaps + uncertainty (no podium edge). **Model B is a
  split:** stop-count = validated telemetry edge → ship as *supporting + SC-caveated*
  capability and an explainer hook (deg→stops is teachable); dominant compound = NO-GO,
  runs on historical "typical compound here."
- **Product pivot (owner-driven, now LOCKED into PRD/CLAUDE):** explainer-led product
  with honest **calibrated** podium probabilities (standings + form + prior-year-track-
  pace + grid-as-available, sharpening Friday→Saturday; qualitative bands until
  calibration matures); telemetry differentiator = stop-count strategy + pace-gap
  context, not podium. Calibration improves as 2026 data accumulates ("learns the season").
- **Learning layer design (PRD §6.6):** **whats** (knowledge, trusted by verification) +
  **whys** (per-prediction grounded narratives, trusted by grounding, linked to whats).
  Whats = hand-authored **concept whats** (evergreen) + dynamically-retrieved **entity
  whats** (allowlist → Haiku short original paraphrase → cite+link → cache, auto
  "drafted, unverified"). Hard facts from `drivers.json`, never cached prose; per-type
  TTL refresh on the race-weekend ops cadence; badge resets to "drafted" on change.

## 🛠️ 4. Immediate Next Steps & Open Questions

**M1 is COMPLETE (branch `m1-productionize-pipeline`). Build continues at PRD §11 M2 (dependency-ordered, no dates):**
1. ✅ **M1 — Productionize the Phase 1 pipeline:** DONE. Callable core library (no app
   scaffolding yet — that's M2). Spec/plan in `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-14-m1-*`.
   - **Batch layer** `src/pipeline.py` (the ONLY code that imports fastf1 + touches `cache/`)
     builds & persists parquet feature tables via `src/store.py`.
   - **Inference layer** `src/inference/{lookup,pace,strategy}.py` reads ONLY the parquet
     tables (never fastf1 — enforced by `tests/test_inference_no_fastf1.py`), trains the
     cheap model at call time on strictly-prior weekends through the single leakage
     chokepoint `store.prior_weekends` (true calendar order from `src/calendar.py`).
   - Three callables: `lookup_stat` (no ML), `predict_pace_gaps` (Model A, demoted —
     deltas + per-tree uncertainty), `predict_stop_counts` (Model B, +0.07 edge, always
     with `SC_CAVEAT`). Sparse-prior → qualitative band, not fake precision.
   - 74 tests pass; nb 06 still reproduces the validated **+0.07** stop-count edge verbatim.
   - **Deferred to M2 (when the API response schema is defined):** dedup `MIN_TRAIN_RACES`
     (declared in both pace.py + strategy.py) and the per-callable target-row lookup into a
     shared home (e.g. `store.target_weekend`); normalize return shapes across the 3
     callables (the empty-target qualitative branch omits `n_train_races`).
2. ✅ **M2 — Thin end-to-end slice:** COMPLETE — verified **end-to-end on a live Vercel
   preview deploy** (exceeds the original local-only DoD). Branch `m2-thin-end-to-end-slice`;
   spec/plan in `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-14-m2-*`.
   Anchor query "How much time is lost in the pit lane at Monaco?" flows
   NL→parser→Python→narrative→ASCII/dither reveal. Build: Next.js (App Router, TS) at
   repo root; the two Haiku calls run in the Next server (`app/lib/{parser,narrative,
   orchestrate}.ts` + `app/api/ask/route.ts`); the Python serverless fn `api/inference.py`
   is pure inference wrapping `src.inference.lookup` (fastf1-free); `app/components/Reveal.tsx`
   is the shared reveal. Added a curated **Monaco** entry to `src/features/track.py`
   (`pit_loss_s 19.5`). 79 pytest + 9 vitest tests pass; `npm run build` clean.
   - **Final paths note:** the Python fn landed at `api/inference.py` (URL `/api/inference`),
     not the design doc's earlier `api/py/lookup.py` text — the plan's File Structure is
     authoritative and the `/api/ask` route targets `/api/inference`.
   - **VERIFIED (2026-06-15) on Vercel preview** `sector4-…vercel.app`: `POST /api/inference`
     → 200 `{value:19.5}` (the Python fn IS reached → **Next ↔ Python `/api` routing coexists
     on real Vercel, no shadow/collision**); `POST /api/ask` → grounded 19.5s narrative;
     off-slice query → honest unsupported message. Browser shows the card + reveal + "Powered
     by Shaders". Also smoke-verified locally: standalone Python HTTP handler, and a guarded
     live-Haiku test (`app/lib/live.smoke.test.ts`).
   - **`vercel dev` caveat (learned):** for a Next.js project `vercel dev` runs only `next dev`
     and does **not** serve top-level Python `/api/*` functions (Next owns `/api/*`, returns
     404). So the Next↔Python hop is **not** testable under `vercel dev` — it must be verified
     on a real deploy (as done). The M2 spec's "vercel dev faithfully emulates prod" assumption
     was wrong for the Next+Python combo.
   - **Deploy mechanics (for next time):** `.vercelignore` now excludes local `.venv/cache/data/
     node_modules/.next/.claude` (the fastf1 cache had a >100MB file that failed upload). The
     `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` was passed per-deploy via `--env`; for a persistent/prod deploy set it
     as a project env var instead. Preview **Deployment Protection** was relaxed to test (it
     401s server-to-server fetches); owner may re-enable. Deploy was a **preview**, not prod.
   - **DONE (was deferred): Python fn dependency slimming.** `src/inference/__init__.py` is now
     lazy (the `lookup_stat` path no longer imports sklearn — guarded by a subprocess test in
     `tests/test_inference_no_fastf1.py`); `requirements.txt` is the **slim runtime set**
     (pandas/pyarrow/numpy) the function ships, and `requirements-dev.txt` holds fastf1/sklearn/
     scipy/matplotlib/pytest for local dev + the batch pipeline. This is what got the function
     under Vercel's 500MB Python Lambda limit (was ~505MB).
   - **Key finding — §6.7 reveal fidelity:** the `shaders` npm pkg (`shaders/react` v2.5.130)
     `Ascii` node ASCII-ifies a child *shader's* output, NOT arbitrary DOM; the only DOM-
     capture path (`DOMTexture`) is Chrome-Canary-flag-gated and explicitly non-production.
     So a true "card text dissolving from ASCII noise" is not production-viable with this
     package. M2 ships a faithful alternative: a decorative ASCII-over-noise backdrop behind
     an always-readable card + GSAP fade; reduced-motion / no-WebGPU → plain fade.
     **Observed in the deployed app: the card currently renders STATICALLY — no animation.**
     Two causes: (1) the GSAP fade is mis-timed — `page.tsx` sets `active` during `loading`
     too, so the fade fires on the empty loading placeholder and never re-runs when the card
     content mounts (effect deps `[fallback, active]` don't change); (2) the shader path is a
     static, WebGPU-gated decorative backdrop, never a content resolve. **Deferred to M3+**
     (when the reveal goes system-wide): fix the fade timing AND choose the real signature-
     reveal approach (different lib / WebGL ASCII / accept canvas-only content). The fade fix
     is small (fire on the answer mounting, not on the loading placeholder).
     **Open product decision for the owner** stands: how faithful to §6.7 to be.
   - **KNOWN DEFECT (tracked — owner approved merge on condition this is fixed):**
     pit-loss is **only curated for 9 circuits** (the dry spike set + Monaco). Any other
     circuit silently returns the generic `_DEFAULTS` **21.0** — but still labelled
     `source: "curated track features"`, i.e. a confidently-WRONG number (violates the
     honesty principle). Compounded by **no circuit-name normalization**: the Haiku parser
     emits free-text names ("Monza", "Spa", "Mexico", "Italian Grand Prix") that don't match
     the curated keys ("Italy", "Mexico City", …), so even curated circuits miss → 21.0.
     Net: only literal "Monaco" works. **Fix (M3 / data work):** (1) derive pit-loss from data
     for ALL circuits per PRD §7.2 (the real answer); (2) until then, make `lookup_stat`
     return an honest "not available for this circuit" (value None) instead of the 21.0
     default for non-curated GPs; (3) normalize circuit names → canonical keys (or constrain
     the parser to a known list). The `_DEFAULTS` prior can stay for the FEATURE pipeline but
     must not be presented to users as a curated fact.
   - **Remaining follow-ups (not blocking M2):** a persistent/production deploy (set
     `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as a project env var; re-enable Deployment Protection if desired);
     the M1-carried cleanups when the API schema grows past lookup (dedup `MIN_TRAIN_RACES`
     across pace.py/strategy.py; normalize the three callables' return shapes).
3. ✅ **M3 — Calibrated podium probabilities (BACKEND slice):** COMPLETE — branch
   `m3-calibrated-podium-probabilities`; spec/plan in `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/
   2026-06-15-m3-*`. New fastf1-free callable `src/inference/podium.py:predict_podium`
   (standings + form + prior-track-pace, + grid as available) returns honest qualitative
   bands (`strong` / `in contention` / `outside shot`) that **sharpen Friday→Saturday**
   (auto-mode: Saturday when grid present). Numeric `p_podium` is returned but flagged
   `calibrated: false` so the %-upgrade is pre-wired. Supporting work: `build_podium_table`
   (pure transform, `src/pipeline.py`), `prior_track_pace` (`src/features/friday.py`,
   moved out of nb 05), `GP_TO_EVENT` (`src/calendar.py`), `store.PODIUM_TABLE`, and
   `band_for` + **dropped `class_weight="balanced"`** in `src/models/podium_model.py`.
   100 pytest + 17 vitest pass. Trust anchor `notebooks/07_podium.py` + `PODIUM_M3_RESULTS.md`
   reproduces the production held-out numbers from real data: **Saturday top-3 0.733 /
   Brier 0.071, Friday 0.689 / 0.085** (unbalanced).
   - **Key findings (this slice):** (a) dropping `class_weight="balanced"` nearly **halves
     Brier** (Fri 0.146→0.085, Sat 0.124→0.071) while top-3 holds — the `strong` band now
     delivers ~0.62–0.64 actual (was 0.86-pred/0.49-actual). Bands confirmed honest, no
     threshold change. (b) nb 05's **"0.711 Friday" was a qsim-inner-join artifact** (the
     cut feature dropped ~1 weekend); the honest production Friday is **0.689**. (c) Saturday
     0.733 still trails raw grid (~0.778) — podium stays positioned as honest probabilities,
     not a telemetry edge.
   - **%-transition contract (M5 inherits, spec §5):** showing numeric % is gated on
     **measured** calibration (enough 2026 data to fit isotonic/Platt **and** a passing
     reliability check), NOT on a date. Bands are the honest default; % is an earned upgrade.
   - ✅ **LIVE PREVIEW INTEGRATION (this session, Option B = per-request inference):** podium
     is now queryable end-to-end in the M2 app and **VERIFIED on a real Vercel branch preview**.
     `api/podium.py` is a dedicated serverless fn running `predict_podium` LIVE (ships sklearn +
     the 17KB `api/podium_features.parquet`; the whole fn is **~371MB, well under Vercel's 500MB
     limit** — the M2 overage was batch-only deps (fastf1/matplotlib), NOT the ML stack). Wiring:
     parser gained a `predict_podium` intent + `year` entity; `app/lib/circuits.ts` normalizes
     free-text circuits (Monza→Italy, Jeddah→Saudi Arabia, …) for the 8-circuit slice (defaults
     year→2024); `generatePodiumNarrative` (grounded, probabilistic); a barebones ranked-bands
     card (no glyphs yet) with a "not yet calibrated" note. `requirements.txt` now carries
     scikit-learn/scipy (both `/api` fns still fit). `vercel.json` ships the table via an
     `includeFiles` brace glob. **Verified live:** `POST /api/podium` 200; `POST /api/ask`
     end-to-end for "2024 Italian GP podium", "Monza 2025" (alias+year), and the pit-loss
     regression. **Gotcha (cost a redeploy):** Vercel env vars are per-environment — the key
     was only on Production, so branch previews 500'd until `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` was added to the
     **Preview** env (then redeploy; existing deploys don't pick up new vars). **MERGED via
     PR #3 to `main` → live on PRODUCTION** (`sector4-zeta.vercel.app`); the rotated
     `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set on prod + preview envs.
4. ✅ **M3 FRONTEND — ASCII/dither glyph + UI system (COMPLETE — MERGED to `main`, live on
   PRODUCTION):** was branch `m3-frontend-glyph-system` (merged `--no-ff` as `d8a559d`, then
   deleted local+remote); spec+plan in `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-15-m3-frontend-
   glyph-system*` + a polish spec/plan `…/2026-06-18-m3-frontend-polish*` (specs predate the
   ASCII pivot + polish below — treat the code as authoritative). **41 vitest + Python suite
   green, `npm run build` clean on the merged result.** The look went through several owner-driven
   iterations; the CURRENT (shipped) state is:
   - **Background = plain `#FAFAFA`.** The aurora was REMOVED (`AuroraBackdrop.tsx` deleted) — owner
     wanted a flat colour. `tailwind bg`/`body` = `#FAFAFA`.
   - **ASCII technique = 1NCOGNIT0 dot-matrix** (`app/lib/ascii-bitmap.ts`): font-free 5×5 bitmap
     glyphs (dot→plus→x→hash→bigdot) chosen by brightness, lit sub-cells tinted by source colour.
     Ported from the etlaM21/1NCOGNIT0 Spark AR `asciiShader.sca`. Runs on **canvas 2D** (no
     WebGPU/WebGL) — chosen because the `shaders` pkg can't ASCII-ify DOM/SVG (M2 finding, still true).
   - **Fog** `app/components/AsciiFog.tsx` — CONFINED to the action zone under the query bar (NOT
     full-page; owner: "only where the action is"). Field is **domain-warped FBM** (`app/lib/noise.ts`,
     not sines — sines read as a rotating pattern) so it churns organically, + a **cursor-radius
     brighten** (inspired by the reactbits "Dither" background; `MOUSE_RADIUS`/`MOUSE_GAIN`). Edge-
     masked to a soft ellipse in `app/page.tsx`; a radial white scrim sits behind content for legibility.
     Static single frame + no pointer reactivity under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
   - **Helmets** `app/components/AsciiGlyph.tsx` — rasterise the helmet SVG off-screen → sample
     (`app/lib/ascii.ts`, per-cell coverage+colour) → draw a **dither field of coverage-scaled squares**
     (solid where filled, fine particles at edges — NOT the gappy dot-matrix, which read as a lattice).
     Team colour retained; the rasterised numeral is baked OUT and a **crisp contrast-guarded number is
     overlaid** (`NUMBER_POS` in `helmet.ts`) for legibility. **Scattered dither-resolve reveal** (cells
     develop in, numeral fades last); reduced-motion → instant. `DriverGlyph.tsx` (plain SVG, shared
     paths in `helmet.ts`) is the SSR/no-canvas fallback. Verified live: 4 `<canvas>` helmets, 0
     vector fallbacks; numbers 4/81/16/33 legible, team colours correct.
   - **Source of truth + type system (unchanged from first iteration):** `app/data/drivers.json` (codes
     → name/number/personalColor) + `app/data/teams.json` (incl. both `RB` + `Racing Bulls`); year-correct
     `team` comes from the API (`build_podium_table`/`predict_podium`/`api/podium.py`). 4 self-hosted font
     roles via `app/lib/fonts.ts` (`next/font/local`); **Bebas Neue = wordmark ONLY**. Empty (pre-query)
     state = hint + example chips (`app/page.tsx`).
   - **KEY BUILD GOTCHAS FIXED (don't reintroduce):** (a) `next/font/google` fails to fetch gstatic in
     the Vercel build → self-host all fonts. (b) unanchored `data/` in `.vercelignore` stripped
     `app/data/*.json` → root-anchored. (c) Lastik web fonts must be committed (`app/fonts/lastik/*.woff2/
     .woff`; `.otf/.ttf` desktop originals are gitignored). (d) the `shaders` pkg can't ASCII-ify DOM. (e)
     Vercel env vars are per-environment — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` must be on **Preview** too (it is). (f)
     canvas `ctx.font` can't resolve CSS vars → numeral overlay uses a concrete `Arial` stack.
   - **POLISH PASS (shipped, branch then merged):** randomized scattered helmet ASCII reveal
     (`app/lib/scatter.ts`); bolder/darker confined fog; **animated suggested-query chips** — one at a
     time, edge-anchored random positions, fade in/out (`app/components/QueryChips.tsx` + `app/lib/chips.ts`);
     removed the shaders.com attribution; **F1-team-radio loading lines** rotating per query
     (`app/lib/loading-lines.ts`, 15 owner-authored lines); an **ORIGINAL spinning racing-tyre Ask-button
     loader** (`app/components/TyreSpinner.tsx` — black slick + white sidewall + 2 red compound stripes
     + SECTOR4 wordmark + 10-spoke rim; rolls in from the left, spins, rolls out right; NO Pirelli marks
     per PRD §8); **query-bar focus underglow** that eases in (transition + delayed breathing keyframes,
     `.bar-shell::after` in `globals.css`); an edgeless `.legible` white wash so answer/empty text reads
     over the fog; wordmark set to `SECTOR4`; pixel fonts (`PP Mondwest` serif, `PP NeueBit`) wired via
     `app/lib/fonts.ts`. **Deleted in polish:** `app/components/Reveal.tsx`, `app/lib/reveal-fallback.ts`,
     `app/components/PixelSpinner.tsx`, and the **`shaders` npm dep** (it could never ASCII-ify DOM). A
     pixel-edge clip-path treatment on the bar/button was tried and DISCARDED (owner: too harsh).
   - **NEXT:** **M4 — telemetry differentiators** (pace-gap context + stop-count strategy). Deferred
     still from the visual system: car/tire/track glyphs (M4 — the `TyreSpinner` glyph is reusable),
     hover callouts (M6), favicon (M7), live-2026.
   - **A future LANDING PAGE** fronting the product is an owner goal (saved to memory) — reuses this
     glyph system + palette; separate effort, not M3.
5. **M4 — Telemetry differentiators (IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE on branch
   `m4-telemetry-differentiators`; spec+plan in `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/
   2026-06-20-m4-*`; SDD ledger in `.superpowers/sdd/progress.md`). Shipped architecture:**
   - **Three Python serverless fns mirror `api/podium.py`:** `api/pace.py`
     (`predict_pace_gaps`, ships `pace_features.parquet`+`team_map.parquet`+sklearn),
     `api/strategy.py` (`predict_stop_counts`, ships `strategy_features.parquet`+
     `team_map.parquet`+sklearn), and the SLIM `api/inference.py` (now also serves
     `tyre_deg`/`stint_length` from the bundled `strategy_features.parquet`, still
     sklearn-free — guarded). `vercel.json` `includeFiles` updated for all four fns.
   - **`predict_stop_counts` gained an additive race-level `dominant` summary** (modal
     n_stops + share + n_drivers; `None` in the qualitative branches) so the StrategyCard
     leads with the track-level call. Per-driver detail is secondary (owner: teams differ,
     strategy is track/conditions-driven). `SC_CAVEAT` always present + rendered.
   - **Team colour for non-podium helmets:** new `src/pipeline.py:build_team_map` (pure
     transform from `season_results` via `GP_TO_EVENT`, keyed on short gp) → `data/team_map
     .parquet`; new `src/inference/teams.py:attach_teams` joins team at the serverless
     boundary (team is glyph metadata, NEVER a model input). New store paths
     `store.SEASON_RESULTS` + `store.TEAM_MAP`; `build_all` writes the team map too.
   - **Honesty fix:** `src/features/track.py:CURATED_TRACKS`; `lookup_stat` pit_loss returns
     `value None`/"not available for this circuit" for non-curated GPs (the `_DEFAULTS` 21.0
     prior stays for the FEATURE pipeline only). `StatAnswer` skips the number block on null.
   - **Frontend:** `circuits.ts` adds `normalizeLookupCircuit(raw, stat)` (pit_loss = 8 +
     Monaco; deg/stint = the 8); `parser.ts` tool descriptions tightened (intents already
     existed); `orchestrate.ts` adds `predict_pace`/`predict_strategy` branches + deg/stint
     lookups (`Answer` union + `AnswerDeps` extended); `narrative.ts` adds grounded
     `generatePaceNarrative` (supporting-not-podium) + `generateStrategyNarrative`
     (deg→stops, SC caveat); `app/api/ask/route.ts` dispatches via a `postJson` helper;
     `app/page.tsx` adds `PaceCard` + `StrategyCard`.
   - **Feature tables regenerated** via `build_all()` (8 dry circuits, 2023–25; from the
     local fastf1 cache) and copied into `api/`. Regen: `PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python -c
     "from src.pipeline import build_all; build_all()"` then `cp data/{pace,strategy}_
     features.parquet data/team_map.parquet api/`.
   - **VERIFIED locally:** 121 pytest + 51 vitest pass, `npm run build` clean, nb 06 trust
     anchor +0.070 verbatim. **VERIFIED on a live Vercel preview** (`sector4-j0tvoxvt6-…
     vercel.app`, deploy `dpl_J1vBUr4NGQpaX5iJk5uhDmVJQxx5`): all four Python lambdas built;
     `/api/pace`, `/api/strategy`, deg/stint lookups, non-curated pit-loss (honest `null`),
     and `/api/ask` end-to-end (pace/strategy/deg, aliases normalized, grounded narratives)
     all correct. **REMAINING: merge the branch (owner decision). Optional: owner browser
     eyeball of the PaceCard/StrategyCard visuals.**
   Then **M5 private beta at a real 2026 weekend (forcing function)**, M6 learning layer,
   M7 breadth+polish. See PRD §11.

**Open questions / uncertainties to validate later:**
- **Podium probability calibration** — current probs are overconfident; needs
  isotonic/Platt + more data before any "%” is shown in UI.
- **Safety-car uncertainty for strategy** — the +0.07 stop-count edge is on a dry,
  SC-clean backtest; live accuracy will be lower. Need an explicit SC-uncertainty band.
- **Small-sample caveat everywhere** — ~22 weekends; deltas of ±0.02–0.09 are partly
  noise. Re-confirm on more circuits/seasons before over-committing.
- **Compound sample is thin** (15 races, HARD-skewed) — "no edge" is directional only.

## 🚦 5. Instructions for the Next Session

Phase 1 is finished and the repositioning is locked into the PRD/CLAUDE; treat the
validated split as settled (stop-count strategy = real telemetry edge; podium/compound =
baseline-driven) and the product as explainer-led, not predictive-edge. **M1/M2/M3-backend
AND the M3 FRONTEND (the ASCII/dither glyph + UI system) are all merged to `main` and live
in production** (see §4 item 4 for the shipped architecture + polish). The immediate next
milestone is **M4 — telemetry differentiators (pace-gap context + stop-count strategy)**.
Start any new build only when the user asks. Preserve the load-bearing
invariants when extending: inference must never import fastf1; all training must go through
`store.prior_weekends` (calendar order, never alphabetical); round every number that reaches
output; keep all logic in `src/`; on the frontend keep the ASCII rendering on canvas (the
`shaders` pkg can't ASCII-ify DOM) and gate all motion behind `prefers-reduced-motion`; and
do not oversell predictions in any code, copy, or UI.

## 🏁 6. M5 — Private beta (IN PROGRESS, branch `m5-private-beta`, NOT merged)

**Goal:** issue predictions for a real 2026 weekend before quali, sharpen after, send to
testers, log outcomes. Rolling beta: **Austrian GP (race 2026-06-28, non-sprint)** first,
then **British GP (2026-07-05, sprint)**. Spec/plan/ledger paths in the header above.

### De-risk gate (PASSED, `scripts/derisk_2026.py`)
2026 is REAL in fastf1: 22 rounds, **Austria = round 8**, **7 rounds completed** with
results (Australia, China, Japan, Miami, Canada, Monaco, Barcelona — note: no Bahrain/Saudi/
Imola at the front this season; 2026 has BOTH "Barcelona GP" round 7 AND "Spanish GP"/Madrid
later, as distinct keys). **Austria FP is pending** (weekend runs ~Jun 26) → telemetry lights
up at issuance; podium is buildable now. Prior Austria (2024/2025) loads fine.

### Architecture pivot (locked with owner): hybrid-staged
A plan gap surfaced: the backtest builders derive a weekend's row from COMPLETED sessions
(race pace + finish + grid), so they **cannot predict a future weekend**. Resolution:
- **Podium = runtime target-row construction, no fastf1, no redeploy.** `src/inference/
  upcoming.py` builds the Austria target row from `season_results` (standings/form) +
  bundled historical pace (`prior_track_pace`) + entry list + optional grid (None → Friday
  mode, filled → Saturday). `predict_upcoming_podium` appends it to history and runs
  `predict_podium`. **This is the "issue before quali, sharpen after" mechanism.**
- **Telemetry = scheduled GitHub Actions fastf1 job → Vercel Blob** (the "right after"
  stage); `api/{pace,strategy}` read FP features from Blob. fastf1 NEVER runs serverless.
- **Cron snapshots** the runtime predictions to Blob at checkpoints; `/weekend` reads latest.

### DONE this session (18 commits; 137 pytest + 64 vitest + clean tsc)
- Real 2026 calendar (`RACE_CALENDAR`, full `GP_TO_EVENT`; `calendar_order()` default now
  flattens it). Austria + Britain curated track facts. `circuits.ts` 2026 normalization +
  `DEFAULT_YEAR=2026` (orchestrate uses it).
- **Recency-weighted training** (`src/inference/weights.py`, wired into pace + stop-count
  `half_life_years=2.0`). **Re-validated: +0.070 stop-count edge holds with weights**
  (`scripts/validate_recency_weights.py`, `notebooks/M5_RECENCY_RESULTS.md`). NOTE: the
  plan's first validation script used the wrong model/metric (0.507) — the committed one
  faithfully reproduces nb06's regressor+round anchor (0.641 baseline / 0.711 / +0.070).
- **`src/inference/upcoming.py`** — target-row builder + runtime upcoming-podium (gap fixed:
  real ranked bands, Fri→Sat sharpening; bands stay `calibrated:false`).
- `load_results` gained `refresh_year` (live-season staleness).
- Pure delivery cores: `app/lib/{snapshot,weekend-schedule,actuals,build-snapshot}.ts`
  (schema/keys, checkpoint resolver, Brier+top-3 scoring, snapshot builder) +
  `app/data/weekend-schedule.json` (Austria session times — UPDATE per weekend).

### R8 (data build) + R11-glue: DONE + verified on real data
`scripts/build_2026.py` ran clean (after a load fix — `load_session` now returns None when
a session loads but has no laps; fastf1 doesn't raise for future races). Tables rebuilt +
copied to `api/` (incl. NEW `api/season_results.parquet`). 2026 has **22 drivers/round**
(11 teams — reg reset). `api/podium.py` now routes: historical → `predict_podium`; KNOWN
upcoming circuit (in `GP_TO_EVENT`, no table row) → `predict_upcoming_podium` (optional
`grid` in body); unknown → empty qualitative. **VERIFIED:** `predict_upcoming_podium(2026,
Austria)` → mode `friday`, 29 train weekends, bands HAM strong 0.68 / ANTONELLI,PIASTRI,
RUSSELL,LEC,VER in contention; full-grid request → `saturday`. 144 pytest + 64 vitest + tsc
clean. To rebuild tables (e.g. after a new round): rerun `build_2026.py` then the `cp` lines
it prints.

### Delivery layer — BUILT + LIVE-VERIFIED on preview (branch `m5-private-beta`, PR #4)
`app/lib/blob.ts` (`@vercel/blob` putJson/getJson), `app/api/cron/snapshot/route.ts`
(idempotent, CRON_SECRET-auth, dueCheckpoint→buildSnapshot→Blob; final→actuals→calibration),
`api/results.py` (finishing order), `app/weekend/page.tsx` (reads latest snapshot),
`vercel.json` crons. Verified live on preview `sector4-git-m5-private-beta-…vercel.app`:
`/api/podium {2026,Austria}`→HAM strong 0.68 friday; `/api/ask`→grounded narrative;
`/api/results`→order; `/api/cron/snapshot` (authed, force-test)→snapshotted; `/weekend`
rendered the frozen Blob snapshot. **Full cron→Blob→/weekend loop confirmed.**

**Deploy gotchas learned (load-bearing):** (a) **Hobby plan allows only DAILY crons** —
`vercel.json` cron MUST be daily (`0 6 * * *`); a sub-daily expr makes EVERY deploy fail
silently (no deployment record). (b) **Blob store must be PUBLIC** — `putJson` uses
`access:"public"` and `/weekend` reads via plain fetch; a private store throws "Cannot use
public access on a private store". (c) `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is the var the SDK needs
(not BLOB_STORE_ID/BLOB_WEBHOOK_PUBLIC_KEY) — on Prod+Preview. (d) env changes need a
redeploy to take effect.

### REMAINING
1. **OWNER cleanup from the force-test:** delete test blobs `weekends/2026-Austria/
   {pre-quali,latest}.json` (else idempotency skips the real Jun-26 snapshot); rotate
   `CRON_SECRET` off the throwaway `s4-cron-test` back to a random sensitive value (redeploy).
2. **R17 — SCAFFOLDED as a TEMPLATE (activate + verify at the first real weekend).**
   **ACTIVATION (owner):** the workflow lives at `docs/ops/refresh-weekend-data.yml` because
   the controller's git/gh token lacked GitHub's `workflow` scope (can't push under
   `.github/workflows/`). To enable it: copy that file to
   `.github/workflows/refresh-weekend-data.yml` and push with a token that has `workflow`
   scope (or paste it via the GitHub web "Add file" UI). Then it's a
   scheduled (Fri/Sat/Sun) + manual GH Actions job that runs
   `scripts/build_2026.py`, copies tables into `api/`, commits, and pushes → Vercel
   auto-deploys. Telemetry (pace/stop-count) lights up automatically once Austria's FP rows
   exist in the rebuilt tables (the bundled-parquet API already returns qualitative until a
   target row exists — no api changes needed). **Deliberate simplification of the spec's
   "fastf1→Blob overlay"** (commit+deploy reuses the working bundled path, no Blob upload
   from Python, no extra secret). UNVERIFIED until live 2026 FP (June 26); caveats in the
   workflow header (fastf1-in-CI is slow; parquet-in-git grows history; needs Actions
   contents:write + Vercel Git deploy-on-push, both already in place).
3. **Polish — DONE this pass:** `/weekend` now renders a styled podium-odds **table** with
   ASCII helmet glyphs (`AsciiGlyph`) + driver names + band colours, an "About <circuit>"
   facts block, and the home page has a top-right **CTA** → `/weekend`. Spec/plan
   `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-21-m5-weekend-visual-upgrade*`. Still optional:
   grounded narratives on `/weekend` (snapshots don't carry narratives yet).
4. **Merge decision** — PR #4 → `main` (production cron fires daily; prod env already has the
   keys). Update `weekend-schedule.json` per weekend before each beta round.

### M6 hand-off note (fun facts)
`/weekend` "About <circuit>" facts are a **curated hand-authored stopgap**
(`app/data/circuit-facts.json` + `app/lib/circuit-facts.ts`; seeded Austria + Great Britain,
added by hand per weekend). **M6's learning layer must replace them** with the entity-what
pipeline: allowlist source → Haiku original paraphrase → inline citation + link → cache
(per-type TTL) → auto "drafted, unverified" badge + corrections form; hard facts from
`drivers.json`. The `getCircuitFacts(gp)` seam stays; swap its implementation.

**Phase C (sprint-aware podium for British GP) is a separate later plan.**
